# My personal website
This repository holds my work-in-progress website upgrade.

## The current website
Currently, there's not a lot of public-facing content on the site, and I have mainly been using it to host APIs for personal projects as well as a Maven repository. It was written in plain PHP so part of this upgrade is using a proper modern web framework, so that I can focus more on the content than writing the same boilerplate web code I've written countless times now. 

>The current website is still active at [https://harleyoconnor.com](https://harleyoconnor.com)

## The new website
My main plan for the new website is to host two key things: 

1. A portfolio of some of the projects I have worked on
2. A blog in which I can write about some of my thoughts, focussing on technology

In addition, I will continue to host the Maven repository and any APIs I might like to build for personal projects. Overall, it should be a relatively simple in terms of actual code complexity, and I am more fussed about designing an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly front-end.  

In terms of framework, I decided to use [Laravel](https://laravel.com). I wanted to stick with PHP as this is the language I am most comfortable with for web projects, so Laravel seemed like a natural choice. Further, I did some research on the [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x) to have a look at some of its features and did a small taster project following from some tutorials, and rather liked the syntax and structure of it.
